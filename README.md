# HDir
HotDir program for the Commander X16 in nxtBasic  

Directory listing in color.  

On 1st run a H.DAT file is created in the root folder. It can be edited (EDIT "H.DAT") and you can then change the colors used and add / remove extensions.  

I rename my H.PRG to H and put it in the SDCard root. Then you can run it using ^/H and it will execute from any dir.
